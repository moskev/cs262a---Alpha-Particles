Our application is designed to improve the efficiency of the core operations of Calvin's Knight
Investment Management student club. First among these operations is monitoring the stocks in which
the club has invested. Our application will provide a list of these stocks that will display their
current value and any other information deemed relevant. Due to confidentiality rules, this part of
the app will be password protected. Second, our app will provide a convenient way to display the
club's weekly stock pitches. The subgroup making the pitch will upload the pitch and then members of
the club will be able to open the app to see the details of the pitch. Third, the app will contain
the training guide given to every new member. This will allow both save paper and allow members to
easily go back and look at the training guide.
